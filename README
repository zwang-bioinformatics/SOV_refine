1. Introduction
------------------------------
The script "SOV_refine.pl" can calculate the modified SOV score (Zemla, A. et al., 1999)
and the further refined SOV_refine score. The latter redefined the assignment
of allowance, which can ensure that the amount of allowance is incremental
when one more element in the predicted sequence is further predicted accurately. 

We found that SOV_refine is a better measure than SOV'99 when we attempt to evaluate the
quality of protein models at the secondaty structure level.

It should be noted that this script can handle unlimited number of states in a
reference sequence and different labels (26 English letters) for denoting distinct states. 
But we don't recommend to use it when the number of states is too large (e.g., 10). 

------------------------------
2. Usage 
------------------------------
It can be used on any platform with Perl interpreter. In order to run "SOV_refine.pl", 
you need to provide at least the first two parameters. 

"./SOV_refine.pl (1) (2) (3)"
  (1) is the reference sequence file and should be in fasta format;
  (2) is the predicted sequence file and also should be in fasta format;
  (3) is the lambda value. Its default value is 1 for calculating SOV_refine. Based on our experience, you can set its value to one of the values in the range [0.1, 2]. 

An example
"./SOV_refine.pl exmp/test1.fasta exmp/test2.fasta"

3. Output 
------------------------------
The details about SOV scores for each state and the reference sequence will be
printed on the screen. The output of the example given above is shown below:

--------------------- 
N_L	17
N_S	2
Lambda	1
SOV_99_i	A	0.875
SOV_refine_i	A	0.852
SOV_99_i	B	0.500
SOV_refine_i	B	0.465
Accuracy	0.588
SOV_99	0.650
SOV_refine	0.620
---------------------

(a). "N_L 17" means that the length of the reference sequence is 17.
(b). "N_S 2" indicates that the total number of states in the reference
sequence is 2.
(c) "Lambda" indicates the lambda value used in calculating SOV_refine.
(d) The rows started with "SOV_99_i" contain three items: the secondary item denotes
the current state, while the third item is the SOV_99 score for this state;
(e) The rows started with "SOV_refine_i" contain three items: the secondary item denotes
the current state, while the third item is the SOV_refine score for this state;
(f) The global accuracy and SOV scores for all states are given in the rows started with
"Accuracy", "SOV_99", "SOV_refine". In this example, the three global scores are 0.588, 0.65, and 0.62 respectively.
